## Introduction

I like to explore a lot , but with the people who are really interested . So whenever I use to make some plan to visit places , my friends and other people around me used to get drop off from the plan by the end of the day , and initially I wondered they might be busy! *and that can be true as well*. But later I found out that many of them just drop off because *they were not interested* in the **location** than being busy.

So I decided to collect data from the people I know including family members , friends , colleagues. By using this data I will be able to select and contact the right people for planning future trips or vaccations. 

## Data Collection

1. The Data I collected is from the people I know and the groups which I am part of on      whatsapp.

2. I created a google form (*kept it small and simple* so people would respond) to          collect the following data :
    * Name
    * EmailID
    * Favourite Travel Destination :
      + *Beach*
      + *Snowy-Mountains / Cold regions*
      + *Mountains*
      + *Forest*
      + *City*
      + *Countryside*

  ![Data collected using Google forms](data_collection.png)
  
3. The form was restricted for only *one* response per user account to avoid duplication or ambiguous data.

4. The population for the collected data is 47.


# Data Summaries

```{r}
people_data <- read.csv(file="data.csv" , header = TRUE)

# Total Number of People participated in survey
length(people_data$Email.Address)

count_destination <- table(people_data$What.s.your.favourite.travel.destination..)


barplot(count_destination,
        xlab = "Favourite Destination",
        ylab = "Number of People",
        main = "Peoples interest in different travel destination",
        col = c("#4CAF50", "#2196F3","#FF9800","#E91E63","#9C27B0","#FFC107"),
        names.arg = c("Beach" , "City" , "Countryside" , "Forest" , "Mountains" , "Cold region"),
        cex.names = 0.7)



```
1. Total 47 people participated in this survey and their data count for each category is presented In Figure 2.

```{r}
data.frame(count_destination)
```

# Discussion

1. From the above barplot , maximum people about 14 are interested to travel to beach.
2. Only *two* out of 47 people are interested to visit City's
3. *Seven* people are interested in Countryside
4. It is interesting that for Mountains and cold regions the proportion is same.

Proportions of Each travel Destination (in % ) is given below
```{r}
round(100*(prop.table(count_destination)),2)
```

As it is clear from the collected data that maximum people are interested in beaches than any other destination. However this data cannot be generalized to a large population because the people who are the source of data in this assignment are mostly located in same geographic area where I live, and to improve this further , I can collect more data like people living in different countries or people living near the beach , etc. This can provide more details of the popularity of travel destinations. 

Additionally we can ask for more details like profession and age of people and try to find any relation between their preferences according to their age or profession or both.


# Conclusion

This survey was done for myself to be able select the people for my next trip / vacation, So I now know which people to contact when planning a trip to beach or other travel destinations.

# Acknowledgements

I would like to thank all the people who responded to this survey providing me with data for this assignment.
