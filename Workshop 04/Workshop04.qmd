## Loading Data of Birthday
```{r}
birth_month_df <- read.csv("ws04-exercise-birth_months.csv")

birth_month <-birth_month_df$birth_month
```

## Frequency Table
```{r}
frequency_of_bday <- table(birth_month)
frequency_of_bday
```

## Bar Plot
```{r}
barplot(frequency_of_bday,
        main = "Students Born in Different Months",
        xlab = "Months",
        ylab = "Number of Students",
        col = "turquoise",
        cex.names = 0.7)
```

## Probablity Calculation
```{r}
total_students <- sum(frequency_of_bday)
total_students
```
```{r}
winter_months <-c("Dec", "Jan", "Feb", "Mar")
total_studemts_of_winter <- sum(frequency_of_bday[winter_months])
total_studemts_of_winter
```
```{r}
student_born_in_winter <- total_studemts_of_winter / total_students
student_born_in_winter
```
Probablity that a student might be born in winter is 0.21
